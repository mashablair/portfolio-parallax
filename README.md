# portfolio-parallax

##Live site:  

https://mashablair.github.io/portfolio-parallax/


##About:

Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch using the w3schools CSS library.  Main focus here is the parallax effect achieved with CSS and vivid images that I love. 

##Features: 

JS and CSS make the small images interactive when clicked (pop up) or hovered on (opacity filter).  The site is also completely responsive and looks good on different screen sizes, including mobile.  Google maps uses my API key and has a pin.  The button leads users back to my main Bootstrap portfolio.
